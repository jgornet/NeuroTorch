# RSGRU-Net

  Understanding neuronal anatomy can reveal important features of how
  the brain processes and stores information. However, reconstructing
  neurons from high resolution imaging is a tedious and
  challenging. Recent microscopy techniques have emerged that can
  image that can provide images of the entire mouse brain at a single
  cell resolution. These images---more than several terabytes
  each---are exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for humans to
  annotate. Recent deep learning techniques have been developed for
  reconstructing neuronal anatomy from electron microscopy
  images. Following a model for reconstructing neurons using a
  flood-filling approach, we have developed a novel flood-filling
  approach that leverages the GRU layers.
